<div>Hello hello!</div>

<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comp Comm is proud to present the online voting system for the 2020 ExComm Elections, </span><a href="http://democracy.calband.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://democracy.calband.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This site will be used during Banquet to vote for the 2021 ExComm Offices: PRD, Drum Major, StuD, and Exec Sec. Voting is not live yet, but you can still check out the website!</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attached to this email is your voter registration information for the upcoming election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Below is some important information to read before voting.&nbsp;<em>Please read the information presented before Banquet this Wednesday!</em></div>
<ol>
<li>You&nbsp;<em><strong>MUST</strong></em> change your password before voting. If you do not change your password before Banquet, <em>you cannot vote.</em> You can change your password in the link above or just go to <a href="http://democracy.calband.org/change_password">this link</a> to finalize your voter registration.</li>
<li>Please submit a test ballot <a href="http://democracy.calband.org/test">here</a> to get a feel for how the election process will go during Banquet. Voting in this test ballot will also help ensure that the voting system is working properly prior to the actual election.</li>
<li>If you have any issues whether it's changing your password, voting in the test ballot, or something else,&nbsp;<em>please email me or James Marquez ASAP!</em></li>
<li>Make sure that you are making an informed vote! Go through the debate transcipts and videos found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CpTN-do8V4ozRgI88HLzclRVVhvGotjC">here</a> if you haven't already had the chance.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested to see how the system works or have any general questions and want to see a demo, we will be hosting a general info session on Tuesday, Dec. 8th, from 6-7pm at https://berkeley.zoom.us/my/dankmemes/. The first half will consist of general questions and a demo, and the second half will be a technical talk if anyone is interested in seeing how the whole process works. We hope to see you there!</span></p>
